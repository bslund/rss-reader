This project implements an RSS reader element for Polopoly. 

It is packaged as a Polopoly plugin and written in Scala programming language.

Installation:
1. Go to the plugins folder of your project:
     cd <polopoly-project.dir>/plugins
2. Download the plugin:     
     git clone git://github.com/bslund/rss-reader.git
3. Add the artifact to the modules list of <polopoly-project.dir>/plugins/pom.xml:
     <modules>
       <module>rss-reader</module>
       ..
     <modules>
4. Build:
     mvn clean install
5. Import content:
     mvn p:import

If everything went ok, the plugin appears in the plugins list in Polopoly GUI. 
The RSS element can now be created in a content creator for elements.
